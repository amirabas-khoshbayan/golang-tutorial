1
00:00:00,203 --> 00:00:03,917
Mr Shelby, you're not yourself.
I should call a doctor.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,598
It's just myself talking to myself
about myself.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,398
Michael, you're going to New York.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,518
Why?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,398
Because the company has business
to attend to in America.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,720
You knew I was going to be shot...

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,080
...and you chose not to tell me.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,680
I chose my mum.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,078
Thomas Shelby, Labour Party, 48,564!

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,518
I've been to a doctor on your
behalf.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,000
It starts when you stop.
When you rest.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,360
Mr Shelby, you're
meant to be resting.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,600
I have learnt something, Frances.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,598
There's no rest for me
in this world.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,640
Perhaps in the next.

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,638
Arthur?

17
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,760
"We cannot give you the assurance
you are asking for.

18
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,040
"We expect payment in full."

19
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,320
Here's my favourite part.

20
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,998
"We have never even heard
of your people,

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,398
"so we are not afraid
of your threats."

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,200
And they've signed it
"the Angels of Retribution".

23
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,160
Hmm.

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,438
They say
they haven't even heard of us.

25
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,078
So tell Aberama and Isiah to
introduce themselves.

26
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,558
And, Finn...

27
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,440
...you stay out of it.

28
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah?

29
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,038
Wait.

30
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,640
Wait, wait. Say that again.

31
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,838
No.

32
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
No, that cannot be possible!

33
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,920
Peter, my beautiful pilot...

34
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,760
Now, will you please fly me
and my winnings back to England?

35
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,160
Ten spoonfuls of sugar for me,
please.

36
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,038
Where's that full one?

37
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,958
Look, Ruby.

38
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,520
Daddy's back from his call.

39
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,240
Everything's going
to be all right now.

40
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,918
Oh, no, no.

41
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,318
Oh, no, no.

43
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,520
Ah!

44
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,838
Hello?

45
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
Arthur! Arthur, where's Tommy?

46
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,638
Just get to him and tell him
that we've lost the lot!

47
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,678
Stay there. You stay put.

48
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,640
You'll hear from Tommy.

49
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,518
Arthur, what are you talking about?
How is that possible?

50
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,518
It's possible because, this morning

51
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,998
in New York City at 6am,

52
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,598
the Wall Street Stock Exchange
crashed

53
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,518
like a steam train.

54
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,958
We were most definitely on board.

55
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,758
Fuck it.

56
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,358
-Oi! Come on, get changed!
-Jesus Christ!

57
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,958
Bring the car round!

58
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,438
We've got to get out of here.
Hurry up! Come on!

59
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,678
I'm going!

60
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,678
Change of plan.
We're not going to London any more.

61
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,758
-We're going straight to Birmingham.
-There are other passengers.

62
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,838
Not any more.

63
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,838
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

64
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,918
-No. No.
-I love you, you love me.

65
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,558
-That's the truth.
-Gina, wait, come on.

66
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,320
-I want to meet your family.
-No, you don't.

67
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,840
Argh!

68
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,280
Now you've heard of us.

69
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,718
Come on.

70
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,438
Couch. Couch!

71
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,998
Put something down for the blood.
My sister'll fucking kill me.

72
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,718
Be fucking careful!

73
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,998
She spends thousands of pounds
on this shit.

74
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,518
Argh!

75
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,040
Get me some booze. Ah!

76
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,320
Just fucking get the thing out of me
and sew me up. Just do it.

77
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
Peaky boy, give me your blade.

78
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,758
That's enough.

79
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,238
Don't want you throwing up
on your sister's furniture.

80
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,158
-You know what you're doing?
-I've done this a thousand times.

81
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,238
I once took a bullet from between
two ribs, one inch from the heart.

82
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,798
Mind you, it was a horse.

83
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,678
And the horse did die.

84
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,280
Hold him. Hold him.

85
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,440
There you go. Just a little one.

86
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,758
-What the fuck is going on?!
-Oh, fuck.

87
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,598
Hello, Ada.

88
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
Get out, both of you.

89
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,158
Push this on the wound.

90
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,840
-Keep up the pressure.
-Get out.

91
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,998
I'm so sorry, Ada. They broke a
statue of some thin woman.

92
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,198
Fucking statues.

93
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,038
What has Tommy told you?

94
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,718
-Shelbys stay out of the sporting stuff.
-What?

95
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
-To maintain his fucking reputation?
-Oi!

96
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,878
You listen to me.
We've got a chance.

97
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,438
Tommy has given us that chance.

98
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,598
He's got power, we've got money,
and our past is left behind us.

99
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,958
And you've got a precious young
life, Finn, you fucking idiot.

100
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,278
Three inches to the left
and that would have been gone.

101
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,718
You've got nothing to prove, Finn.

102
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,560
You have got nothing to prove.

103
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,438
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Come here, you. Come here. Come here. Come here.

104
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,038
Come here. Come here. Ooh!

105
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,758
Now, what have you been up to, eh?

106
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,280
Get it done, Johnny.

107
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,960
All right, you heard the man.
Let's go.

108
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,878
Where's Charles?

109
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,478
He's in the wagon.
He won't come out.

110
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,518
He heard Johnny talking Rokker.

111
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,998
He understands more Gypsy
than we think.

112
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,958
He heard him say you shot the horse.
I told him it was mercy.

113
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,640
I said it's what you do when a horse
gets sick. He doesn't understand.

114
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Dad, why did you shoot him?

115
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,238
Charlie, get out here now.
Let's get it done.

116
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,560
Charles? Come here.

117
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,040
Sit down.

118
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,040
Now, listen to me.

119
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,638
Your horse was sick. He was in pain.

120
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,478
The vet couldn't do anything,
even Curly couldn't do anything.

121
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,720
I put him to sleep.

122
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,998
-It's what you do.
-No! It's what YOU do!

123
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,680
Shoot horses, shoot people!
Everybody says!

124
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,840
Dangerous, my beautiful horse.

125
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,000
Too wild to race.

126
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,320
Wouldn't take the reins or the whip.

127
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Should have been a war horse.

128
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,280
Got tired of the pasture.

129
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,520
Couldn't stick the peace and quiet,
gave up on life...

130
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,680
...and is now free.

131
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,560
In the bleak...

132
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,400
You're crying.

133
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,838
Tom...

134
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,998
..I'm sorry.

135
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,038
I didn't know your boy spoke Rokker.

136
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,640
Fill it in, Johnny.

137
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,438
It's fine.

138
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,918
I've called the house, the office.

139
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,720
But if I tell you...

140
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,640
...you won't believe it...

141
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,718
...so I'll show you.

142
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,320
Huh?

143
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,118
I told Michael on Friday
this was going to happen.

144
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,998
Yeah.

145
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,118
Fucking Michael...said he was
advised by the broker that prices

146
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,638
would rebound.

147
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,960
Everybody was told the same thing.

148
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,640
He held on.

149
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,320
-Michael held on?
-Yeah.

150
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,360
Michael.

151
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,680
-Michael held on?
-Yeah.

152
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,080
Michael held on...

153
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,640
...and carried on
dancing and playing...

154
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,560
...and fucking in the snow.

155
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,440
Charlie!

156
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
Charlie, come out here now!

157
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,958
Kid never fucking listens.

158
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,080
Never listens, Lizzie!

159
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,878
What do I have to do
to make people

160
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,038
fucking listen to me?!

161
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,278
Holy fuck!

162
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,080
What do we do now, Tommy, eh?

163
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,840
What do we do?

164
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,198
Lizzie, you go with Arthur to
Birmingham,

165
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,598
you stay in the Midland Hotel.
Arthur, call a full meeting of

166
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,638
the board of directors
tomorrow at noon.

167
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,478
A full fucking meeting.

168
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,278
What about today, eh?
What's wrong with today, Tom?

169
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,478
-I need to do some thinking.
-Oh, yeah.

170
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,038
Oh, you do that best on your own,
don't you, eh?

171
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,358
I won't be on my own.
Never on my own.

172
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,878
Lizzie, you have the driver
come back tomorrow.

173
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,080
And, Arthur, tell my boy...

174
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,318
...that sometimes death is a
kindness.

175
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,880
Come on.

176
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
What now?

177
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,478
What am I, a genie?

178
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,920
You summon me up
with your little bottle of dope?

179
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,840
I take it for the pain,
to keep warm.

180
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Is that what it's for?

181
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
The warmth?

182
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,560
The warmth.

183
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,560
All this time...

184
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,200
I know.

185
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Our love still remains.

186
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,040
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

187
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
Do what they tell you to do.

188
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
Too much to do, Grace.

189
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,280
The kids...

190
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,760
I need to say goodbye.

191
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
I need to sleep.

192
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,800
Just think, Tom.

193
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,760
Linda!

194
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,958
Oh, there you are, eh?

195
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,678
You're the chairman, Arthur,
so start acting like one.

196
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,440
Chairman, am I, hmm?

197
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,038
No.

198
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,120
I'm the fucking doorman, Linda, hmm?

199
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,200
And you ain't coming in here
tonight, love, dressed like that.

200
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,920
Tommy made me chairman so that...

201
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,400
...he could stay clean.

202
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,520
It's called an arrangement.

203
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,080
It's an opportunity.

204
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,120
I know who I am, Linda.

205
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,400
I know who I am
and I'm all right with it.

206
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,000
Finally.

207
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,960
I can live with it.

208
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,720
I need you to be all right with it.

209
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,158
I need you to be
all right with it, eh?

210
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,080
What is it, eh?

211
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
And what do you want, hmm?

212
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,920
What, do you want the chairman?
Do you? Hmm?

213
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,960
With his fancy briefcase
and his gold fountain pen, eh?

214
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,680
What do you want?

215
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,200
Chairman...

216
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,678
...or doorman? Hmm?

217
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,000
You think we can fuck and it'll be
OK and I'll be quiet. Well, I won't.

218
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,198
Every week, your brother's down in London,
making out he's fucking Robin Hood,

219
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,438
champion of the people, while you're
up here running the racket for him.

220
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,198
And according to your "arrangement",
if anything should happen,

221
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,280
it'd be you who takes the blame,
does the time or swings for it.

222
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,280
-And what do you want?
-I want you...

223
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,758
...to take the opportunity

224
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,158
that God and the New York Stock
Exchange has presented to you.

225
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,798
Mr Shelby,
the meeting will be starting soon.

226
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,720
Yeah. All right.

227
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,720
Be right there.

228
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,160
Thank you, Edna.

229
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,880
And shut the door.

230
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,560
OK, now...

231
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
Mmm, they're nice.

232
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,520
...let's begin.

233
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,720
Yesterday, as you all know,
there was a fucking terrible...

234
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,318
There was a terrible disaster. Hmm?

235
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,680
It wasn't just for us.

236
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,360
It was for the whole world.

237
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,880
Happened in New York.

238
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,438
That's where it happened.

239
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,040
And it slowly spread to London.

240
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,720
And then to, er,
fucking Hong Kong. Hmm?

241
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,760
Whole thing...whole thing went up.

242
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,360
Well, actually the whole thing
went fucking down, but...

243
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,600
...we wasn't the
only ones hurt by this.

244
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,240
Whole world is hurt.

245
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,640
A lot of people.

246
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,518
In the papers.

247
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,238
It's all over the news.

248
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,200
-Everyone's talking about it.
-Arthur?

249
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,318
Shouldn't we just wait for Thomas?

250
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
Polly, Arthur's now
the chairman of the board.

251
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,878
Er, Mr Chairman,
perhaps while we wait for Thomas,

252
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,558
I might lighten the gloom and

253
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,198
express, as a relatively new member
of this company, what a pleasure it

254
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,918
is to be in a boardroom that
has so many females in it,

255
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,198
and all females who are both
sharp-witted and decorative.

256
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,678
Yeah, well, we're a very
modern company, Mr Greene.

257
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,078
-Indeed.
-Although there are still some among us who cling to their

258
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,238
old-fashioned values.

259
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,800
How far have we got?

260
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,238
We've established
that ladies are decorative.

261
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,278
We've only just sat down,
Tom.

262
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,958
Actually, um, Arthur has some documents
that he'd like to hand out.

263
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,600
Yeah? What documents?

264
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,678
I was just explaining to everyone,
Tom, that, um, well, we're fucked.

265
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,840
-Ain't that right? Hmm?
-Yes and no.

266
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,958
It is true that a large proportion
of the company's funds

267
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,198
were invested in American stocks
and shares.

268
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,120
Invested or hidden?

269
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,638
All investments are approved
by the board, Linda.

270
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Only the ones that went
through the books, Thomas.

271
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,200
Linda, after this meeting there will
be another meeting, for just family.

272
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,720
Did we vote on this?

273
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,080
-Arthur?
-"Arthur, can't you control your wife?"

274
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,560
We are a very modern company,
Mr Greene.

275
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,918
To be precise,
everything we channelled

276
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,158
through the New York Stock Exchange
is now offering a return

277
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,400
of ten cents to the dollar.

278
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,918
And the Nolan Bank of America,

279
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,518
where we invested our fluidity,

280
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,438
is offering five cents to the dollar
on all deposits.

281
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,158
Yeah.

282
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,158
-There is hope.
-Why?

283
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,640
What have you got in there,
a magic wand?

284
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,358
As nonexecutive director of the
company, I need the permission from

285
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,078
the chairman
to present my strategy to the board.

286
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,518
Permission granted, Tom.

287
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,438
The Peaky Blinders are coming!
The Peaky Blinders are coming!

288
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,800
Micky,
the Peaky Blinders are coming!

289
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,640
Ladies and gents, Peaky Blinders are
on their way. Please vacate. Thank you.

290
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,358
-Good to see you.
-All right, Mr Shelby.

291
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,918
-Mr Shelby...
-Yeah?

292
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,678
-...thank you for what you did.
-What did I do?

293
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,198
He was going to evict us,
that bastard Fellows.

294
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,678
Now he's cut our rent in half.

295
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,960
Good. Glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

296
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,718
All right?

297
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,438
How far can we go, Mr Shelby,
with this beautiful dream?

298
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,598
-All the way, brother. All the way.
-Revolution, man!

299
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,638
This crash, Mr Shelby. They're
saying they're gonna cut my hours.

300
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,078
-Yeah. Where do you work?
-Greenhams Engineering.

301
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,038
Greenham brothers. I know them.
They're not gonna cut your hours.

302
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,918
God bless you. God bless you both.

303
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,478
-Enjoy your drink.
-Gentlemen and ladies.

304
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,678
If you'll all move into the saloon
bar,

305
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,118
where you will all be served
a free pint of stingo.

306
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,278
Any man who served in France
gets a brandy chaser.

307
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,758
And in spite of what you're reading
in the newspapers,

308
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,958
I want to hear singing and laughing.
Fuck the stock market.

309
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,238
Fuck the stock market!

310
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,600
They backed the wrong horses,
so fucking what, eh?

311
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,158
Thank you, Mr Shelby. At last,
a politician who gets things done.

312
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,958
You're welcome, brother, you're
welcome.

313
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,638
-Get down off the furniture.
-Sorry, Ada.

314
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,320
I was getting excited, wasn't I?

315
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,680
Right.

316
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,678
Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

317
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,798
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet.

318
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,718
Your husband believes that being
seen

319
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,118
mixing with the common people
is good politics.

320
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,278
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism, perhaps next time,

321
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,878
Polly, you won't wear earrings worth
more than the pub.

322
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,838
Right. Family meeting. First item.

323
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,480
This.

324
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,758
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday

325
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,278
by Aberama Gold using your gin
and a razor blade.

326
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,958
Finn?

327
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,558
He says they were sent to Limehouse.
Chinatown.

328
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,278
Sent by fucking who?

329
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,678
Sent by me.

330
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,160
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.

331
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,398
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart,
I listen to you.

332
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,158
I listen to you when you tell me

333
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,438
no more sport for anyone named
Shelby.

334
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,560
I listen to you
when you make me promises.

335
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,360
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

336
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,598
£50,000.

337
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,038
In cash.

338
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,120
He said they were sent to
Chinatown to kill somebody.

339
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,598
That kid needs educating,
Tommy, really does.

340
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,158
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

341
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,958
-It was a particular opportunity.
-A particular opportunity

342
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,918
presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.

343
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,078
But you told Polly.

344
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,478
Tommy told me there was
a pimp in East London who sold kids.

345
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,958
Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh?
Hmm?

346
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,478
This pimp was blackmailing a senior
member of the House of Lords,

347
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,478
-a very wealthy man.
-Now this pimp is lying in a ditch,

348
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,758
covered in flies.
World's a better place.

349
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,360
Holy fuck! So now your business
is improving the world?

350
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,920
Sometimes, Ada...

351
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,198
...killing is a kindness.

352
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,560
Hmm?

353
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,158
The man we did the job for
is a High Court judge.

354
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,958
We received intelligence from

355
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,398
a senior police officer
in Scotland Yard.

356
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,998
I've made lots of new friends in
London. Men with influence.

357
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,398
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

358
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,278
He wasn't worth a trial. The coppers
cleared the streets for us.

359
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,918
This was work commissioned by a High
Court judge, by Scotland Yard

360
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,478
and by the House of Lords.

361
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,958
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

362
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,598
-And it was the right thing to do.
-Fucking right.

363
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,478
Lizzie, you need to understand.

364
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,078
-That you tell Polly, not me.
-You need to understand that the

365
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,238
corridors of Westminster
are very dimly lit.

366
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,678
And for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

367
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,198
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?

368
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,718
-"We"? WE own the ropes, do we?
-Lizzie, Lizzie, if Finn had've

369
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,158
listened to me, you wouldn't have
known.

370
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,240
When we go home, I'll explain.

371
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,600
I can't be bothered
with this shit.

372
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,038
So...

373
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,160
...Tommy Shelby MP.
Business as usual.

374
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,278
The strategy I outlined earlier

375
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,918
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

376
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,638
-In the meantime...
-Just business as fucking usual.

377
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,358
In the meantime, it is fortunate
that we have maintained

378
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,838
other sources of cash income.

379
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,438
Because until the stock market
recovers, cash is king.

380
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,798
And cash we have.

381
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,638
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

382
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,400
You're gonna hang yourself.

383
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,638
Someone has to pay for them
paintings on your wall, Ada.

384
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,120
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

385
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,478
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.

386
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,478
Polly...

387
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,320
...when am I ever
not easy on Ada, eh?

388
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,598
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

389
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,160
She's pregnant.

390
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,638
Ada's what?!

391
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,198
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

392
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,760
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

393
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,798
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hmm?

394
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,318
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

395
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,798
we've a lot to do, and no-one gives
a fuck who the father is.

396
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,040
Really?

397
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,520
I already know who the father is.

398
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,000
But we've had
enough shocks for one day.

399
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,200
OK.

400
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,918
All right, go on, then.

401
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,758
How long you known about Ada, huh?

402
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,120
I know her doctor. He calls me.

403
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,998
Yeah, longer than me.

404
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,880
Have a look at this.

405
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,798
What's that funny writing on there?

406
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,358
Chinese.

407
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,920
Ah, right.

408
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,720
What is it? Hmm?

409
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
Bad news?

410
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,560
Maybe.

411
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,598
-Angels of Retribution?
-Yeah.

412
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,078
Burn the letter they sent.

413
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,880
It's already done.

414
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,560
Look at that, Tom. Hmm?

415
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,200
Pulled from our brother, eh?

416
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,640
Finally took a first bullet.

417
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,640
No-one fucking listens to me.

418
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,278
Here, give it here.
I'll keep it for him.

419
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,080
I still have my first one.

420
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,600
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

421
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,238
Where are you going, brother?

422
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,478
The huge losses
on the British Stock Exchange

423
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,438
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

424
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,678
I therefore must ask the trade
unions to possess understanding.

425
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,558
The need for their flexibility
and cooperation is paramount

426
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,718
in the coming months as we attempt
to rebuild this great nation.

427
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
Mr Thomas Shelby.

428
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,920
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

429
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,638
My right honourable friend,
the member for Epping,

430
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,838
asks that following the crash,

431
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,120
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

432
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,280
What he's really asking is that the
working man carry the can.

433
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,438
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

434
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,278
when compared to the wild games of

435
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,598
chance being played
in London and New York

436
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,718
by gamblers in silk gloves and

437
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,878
beaver hats, who,
when they lose their bets,

438
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,238
turn around and ask the shoe-shine
to pay for it.

439
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,478
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and can carriers of South Birmingham

440
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,038
and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest

441
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,918
that those who so recklessly lost

442
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,278
their fortunes
on the capitalist lottery

443
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,758
learn to shine their own shoes...

444
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,958
...carry their own can
and pay their own bills.

445
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,880
Mr Shelby?

446
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,238
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

447
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,838
You speak very eloquently.

448
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,678
Thank you.

449
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,718
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.

450
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,518
Yeah, I know who you are.

451
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,758
My constituency borders yours.

452
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,160
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

453
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,000
Come.

454
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,760
Ah.

455
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,680
I have bad news, Mr...

456
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,760
Shelby.

457
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,558
We agreed 50,000
on completion of business.

458
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,678
My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

459
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,878
There's 20 there.

460
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,760
You'll have to wait for the rest.

461
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,638
-Cavalry, eh?
-Mm.

462
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,800
Huh!

463
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,160
Yeah.

464
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,600
I spent a long of time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

465
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,800
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

466
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,638
When the cavalry finally came,

467
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,318
an officer,
on the back of a fine white horse,

468
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,120
joked that he'd been delayed
playing a game of whist.

469
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,198
So I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

470
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,878
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

471
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,640
All for a game of chance.

472
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,838
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

473
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,638
they collected all the photographs,
letters and cheques

474
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,838
that will cause you concern.

475
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,118
I now have them in a safe place.

476
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,920
On Monday you will give me
the full £50,000 in cash...

477
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,720
...or I will steal your
white horse from under you.

478
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,718
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

479
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,398
in a place of power and privilege?!

480
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
A man like me?

481
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,640
A man like me?

482
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,998
Lord Suckerby...

483
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,920
..I've seen the photographs.

484
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,120
Monday.

485
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,520
Shelby!

486
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,558
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

487
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,358
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

488
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,758
The police are concerned about the effect
of the crash in industrial areas.

489
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,118
-Right.
-Everything all right?

490
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,758
Yeah, fine.

491
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,120
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

492
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,158
Your brother been busy?

493
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,758
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

494
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,878
the former Communist MP
for Battersea.

495
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,598
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall -

496
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,438
he's setting up a meeting -
and there's talk of a mass walk-out

497
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,278
of bus drivers, Nottingham and
Derby, organised by two Communist

498
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,678
convenors not formerly known to
Special Branch.

499
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,718
He's also had a telephone
conversation with Jessie Eden,

500
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,358
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city.

501
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,118
But he'll report more when he sees
her. It's all in there, though.

502
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,678
Names and everything.

503
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,718
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

504
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,118
Huh. If only he meant it,
he'd be dangerous.

505
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,478
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.

506
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,520
Times are hard.

507
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Hmm.

508
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,160
Exactly how much did you lose?

509
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,878
Don't worry about it.
Tommy has a plan.

510
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,398
He thinks that we can turn the

511
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,038
collapse of the stock exchange to
our advantage.

512
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,598
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

513
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,960
He says, "We can wave cash in the
faces of desperate men."

514
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,558
Tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

515
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,958
I'm told two more military contracts
for vehicles

516
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,000
and parts for the Army in India
are on their way to him.

517
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,320
Fuck.

518
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,878
Come.

519
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,238
Mr Shelby,
this arrived from New York.

520
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,920
It's from Winston Churchill.

521
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,678
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin,

522
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,998
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

523
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,958
So he was in New York
and he doesn't mention the crash.

524
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,238
No. Even though, in the bar last
night, Mr Churchill's private

525
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,400
secretary reckoned he
lost £75,000 in two hours.

526
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,640
And you?

527
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,838
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

528
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,718
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.

529
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,078
You lock up.

530
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,838
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you...
you have one more appointment.

531
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,358
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

532
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,238
A journalist from the Times.

533
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,838
He used to be with
the Birmingham Mail.

534
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,718
He sent you some questions.

535
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,678
You said you wanted to meet him.

536
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,758
He's outside.

537
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,878
Yes.

538
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,400
Send him in.

539
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,280
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the London Times.

540
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,398
Have a seat.

541
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,440
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.

542
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,520
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

543
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,358
No.

544
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,278
Once, in Small Heath, you were
burning photographs of the King.

545
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,518
-London Times. You've done well.
-As have you, sir, to put it mildly.

546
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,918
I sent you a list of questions.

547
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,880
Yeah, I misplaced them.

548
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,398
-Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.
-Yes.

549
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,318
All I remember is
that your questions interested me.

550
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,198
Oh!

551
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,520
Good.

552
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,558
Sorry, just...

553
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,200
Ah, here we are.

554
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,320
Yes, um...

555
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,958
Um... So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

556
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,918
print journalists take no interest

557
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,998
in the, er,
the private lives of politicians.

558
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,838
Private lives?

559
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,158
But in these modern times,
especially in America...

560
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,038
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...

561
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,958
Readers are beginning to say...

562
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,318
..want to know more about the men
who represent them.

563
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,718
Of course.

564
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,680
In these modern times.

565
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,118
Whereas before it would have
been seen as ungentlemanly to, er,

566
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,038
to ask a public figure questions
about personal matters

567
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,038
-or business affairs...
-Oh, well. No need to worry.

568
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm no gentleman.

569
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,560
Hmm.

570
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,998
Er, Mr Shelby,
as I said in my letter,

571
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,760
ten years ago I was a journalist
on the Birmingham Evening Mail.

572
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,198
And of course, working in that city,

573
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,040
it was impossible
not to know your name...

574
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,120
..and your reputation.

575
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,958
So, when I saw that you
had been elected as a socialist...

576
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,878
You reflected on the fact

577
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,120
that working people can indeed
change their lives for the better...

578
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,838
...channel their abilities in new
directions, discover better methods,

579
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,478
aim for happier outcomes,

580
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,318
even win awards for industry.

581
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,198
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

582
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,640
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

583
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,158
Was your conversion from
bookmaker to socialist politician

584
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,080
a gradual thing or...

585
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,000
..a road to Damascus experience?

586
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,278
Yeah.

587
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,040
Now I hear that question...

588
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,518
..I remember receiving your letters

589
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,560
and I distinctly remember your use
of the word "bookmaker".

590
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,158
-Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
-Yes.

591
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,398
I gained a licence
in 1919 for on-track betting.

592
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,478
But, since 1923, I've made my

593
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,478
fortune in the manufacture, sale and
export of motor cars.

594
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,038
And lately gin.

595
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,800
And lately three new homes
for orphaned children.

596
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,518
You can write all this down,
Mr Levitt.

597
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,278
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

598
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,878
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there,

599
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,160
there was a Major Campbell.

600
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,680
He was found dead.

601
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,960
A member of your family was charged.

602
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,920
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

603
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,998
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

604
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,118
Is it evolution or revolution?

605
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,278
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

606
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,998
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart,

607
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,878
what is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

608
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,280
-I am talking about specific events, sir.
-Which I don't recall...

609
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,478
...with which I was never
personally linked,

610
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,480
and after which
all convictions were quashed.

611
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,958
Yeah, now...

612
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,480
..I recall receiving your letter...

613
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
..and I recall that when I did...

614
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,240
..I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

615
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,960
Just a moment.

616
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,760
Here we are.

617
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,998
Ah, Michael Levitt.

618
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,238
Correct?

619
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,478
-Yes.
-Yes.

620
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,278
Journalist.

621
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,158
Unmarried.

622
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,040
An apartment in Maida Vale.

623
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,560
An apartment opposite
the underground station.

624
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,718
"Unmarried" is underlined.

625
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,878
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

626
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,678
Sometimes alone.

627
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,400
Sometimes not alone.

628
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,200
Sometimes with other men.

629
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,240
Sometimes with other men.

630
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,720
I'm old-fashioned...Michael.

631
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,360
I believe private lives
should remain private.

632
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,040
Not everything modern is good,
now, is it?

633
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,160
You gonna write this down...

634
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
...in your little fucking book?

635
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,918
Well?

636
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,838
Not yet.

637
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,638
I didn't tell him.

638
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,960
Him knowing or not knowing has no
relevance to what we're drinking.

639
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,520
It's vintage.

640
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,080
Fuck it.

641
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,600
This...

642
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,160
..is for us.

643
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,440
Let's drink to the baby.

644
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,240
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

645
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,798
You were going to take me to
Cardiff.

646
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,398
I was going to get rid of it.

647
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,080
What about this time?

648
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,880
Imagine.

649
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,238
The father's scared.

650
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,038
He runs away.

651
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,560
You're left.

652
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,598
Oh, sweetheart.

653
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,838
The baby's black,

654
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,840
he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.

655
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,800
But you don't care.

656
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,320
Because the world has changed.

657
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,158
And the baby's eyes are golden.

658
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,398
And you're gonna leave her with

659
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,958
Aunt Polly every day to look after.

660
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,318
Aunt Polly, who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

661
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,518
How do you know it's a her?

662
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,678
Cos I'm Polly Gray.

663
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,558
It's a girl?

664
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,758
Golden.

665
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,158
To be born in the year 1930,

666
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,920
where everything will be changed
for the better.

667
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,560
She'll be the colour
of a Hollywood Oscar.

668
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,240
What will Tommy say?

669
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,120
Tommy knows.

670
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,238
Hmm!

671
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,278
He's also seen that the world's

672
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,640
big and round and
he says, "So what?"

673
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,760
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

674
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,600
We are flying above the rules now.

675
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,000
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

676
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,920
That's the beauty.

677
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,480
Hello, Cyril.

678
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,080
Least you're still talking to me.

679
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,198
Where is everyone?

680
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,080
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

681
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,038
You know, Frances, if there were to

682
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,880
be a snap election
in this house today...

683
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,760
...wouldn't win it...

684
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,718
..not even if I were running
against the devil himself.

685
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,000
-No. I gathered.
-Mm.

686
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,398
Where's Charles?

687
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,680
Charles is in the stable.

688
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,480
Thank you.

689
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,558
Did Arthur explain?

690
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,440
He said it's God's will.

691
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,920
But you're not God!

692
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,800
No, I'm not God.

693
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,240
Not yet.
